Throughout the project I made icons, footers, headers, style.css and more
I started with the basic html set up
Set up grid and array with minimal bootstrap references as I did as much as I could from scratch to test and improve my own skill using google fu and more.
Entered sample texts and texts that can fit into current place of time
Worked on style.css
The overall goal of this assignment was to create a portfolio for later use to reference our works later on when we get more stuff to imput into the portfolio in hopes of helping us advertise ourselves later on to the job market.
Organized each section in the code to make it more readable and understandable.
Went through and organized code to make sure it is all set up and neat
Went into style.css and made sure it would work on mobile devices as well
